Services list
-------------

Use */api/services/* to get a list of all the service that a user can see.

Supported filters are:

- ?hostname - case insensitive matching of a hostname
- ?service_name - case insensitive matching of a service name
- ?customer_name - case insensitive matching of a customer name
- ?project_name - case insensitive matching of a project name
- ?project_group_name - case insensitive matching of a project_group name
- ?agreed_sla - exact match of SLA numbers
- ?actual_sla - exact match of SLA numbers
- ?project_groups -  **deprecated**, use ?project_group_name instead

Ordering can be done by the following fields (prefix with **-** for descending order):

- ?o=hostname
- ?o=template_name
- ?o=customer_name
- ?o=project_name
- ?o=project_group_name
- ?o=agreed_sla
- ?o=actual_sla
- ?o=template__name - **deprecated**, use ?o=template_name instead
- ?o=project__customer__name - **deprecated**, use ?o=customer_name instead
- ?o=project__name - **deprecated**, use ?o=project_name instead
- ?o=project__project_groups__name - **deprecated**, use ?o=project_group_name instead
- ?o=slas__value - **deprecated**, use ?o=actual_sla instead


SLA periods
+++++++++++

Service list is displaying current SLAs for each of the items. By default, SLA period is set to the current month. To
change the period pass it as a query argument:

- ?period=YYYY-MM - return a list with SLAs for a given month
- ?period=YYYY - return a list with SLAs for a given year

In all cases all currently running services are returned, if SLA for the given period is not known or not present, it
will be shown as **null** in the response.

SLA events
++++++++++

Service SLAs are connected with occurrences of events. To get a list of such events issue a GET request to
*/services/<service_uuid>/events/*. Optionally period can be supplied using the format defined above.

The output contains a list of states and timestamps when the state was reached. The list is sorted in descending order
by the timestamp.

Example output:

.. code-block:: javascript

    [
        {
            "timestamp": 1418043540, 
            "state": "U"
        },
        {
            "timestamp": 1417928550,
            "state": "D"
        },
        {
            "timestamp": 1417928490,
            "state": "U"
        }
    ]
