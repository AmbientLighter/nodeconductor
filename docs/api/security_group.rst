Security group list
-------------------

To get a list of Security Groups and security group rules, run GET against *api/security-groups/* as authenticated user.

Supported filters:

- ?name=<group_name> - only groups with defined name
- ?description=<description> - only groups where description starts with defined one
- ?project=<project_uuid> - only groups connected to a defined cloud
- ?cloud=<cloud_uuid> - only groups connected to a defined project

When instantiating a new instance, setting both **project** and **cloud** filters will result in a proper set of
security groups for selection.

Example of valid request (token is user specific):

.. code-block:: http

    GET /api/security-groups/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com


Valid response example:

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Vary: Accept
    Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
    X-Result-Count: 1

        {
            "url": "http://example.com/api/security-groups/1b07456342b44dc49b80e7a63aed8572/",
            "uuid": "1b07456342b44dc49b80e7a63aed8572",
            "name": "http",

            "rules": [
                {
                    "protocol": "tcp",
                    "from_port": 80,
                    "to_port": 80,
                    "ip_range": "0.0.0.0",
                    "netmask": 0
                }

            }
        }
    ]


Create a security group
-----------------------

To create a new security group, issue a POST with security group details to **/api/security-groups/**. This will
create new security group and starts its synchronization with OpenStack.

Example of a request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST /api/users/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com

    {
        "name": "Security group name",
        "description": "description",
        "rules": [
            {
                "protocol": "tcp",
                "from_port": 1,
                "to_port": 10,
                "cidr": "10.1.1.0/24"
            },
            {
                "protocol": "udp",
                "from_port": 10,
                "to_port": 8000,
                "cidr": "10.1.1.0/24"
            }
        ],
        "cloud_project_membership": {
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/project-cloud-memberships/229/"
        }
    }


Update a security group
-----------------------

Security group name, description and rules can be updated. To execute update request make PATCH request with details
to **/api/security-groups/<security-group-uuid>/**. This will update security group in database and starts its
synchronization with OpenStack.

    .. code-block:: http

    POST /api/users/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com

    {
        "name": "Security group new name",
        "rules": [],
    }


Delete a security group
-----------------------

To schedule security group deletion - issue DELETE request against */api/security-groups/<security-group-uuid>/*.
Endpoint will return 202 if deletion was scheduled successfully.
