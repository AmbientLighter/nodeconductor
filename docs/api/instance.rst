Instance list
-------------

To get a list of instances, run GET against **/api/instances/** as authenticated user. Note that a user can
only see connected instances:

- instances that belong to a project where a user has a role.
- instances that belong to a customer that a user owns.

Filtering of instance list is supported through HTTP query parameters, the following fields are supported:

- ?hostname=<hostname> **deprecated**, use ?name=<name> instead
- ?customer=<customer uuid>
- ?customer_name=<customer name>
- ?customer_native_name=<customer native name>
- ?customer_abbreviation=<customer abbreviation>
- ?state=<state symbol>
- ?project=<project uuid>
- ?project=<project name>
- ?project_group=<project group uuid>
- ?project_group=<project group name>
- ?template_name=<template name>
- ?description=<description>
- ?cores=<number of cores>
- ?ram=<size of ram in MiB>
- ?created=<time of creation>
- ?system_volume_size=<size of system disk in MiB>
- ?data_volume_size=<size of data disk in MiB>
- ?type=<type of the resource: IaaS or PaaS>

Sorting is supported in ascending and descending order by specifying a field to an **?o=** parameter.

- ?o=hostname **deprecated**, use ?o=name instead - sort by name (deprecated: ?o=hostname)
- ?o=state - sort by state
- ?o=customer_name - sort by customer name
- ?o=customer_native_name - sort by customer native name
- ?o=customer_abbreviation - sort by customer abbreviation
- ?o=project_group_name - sort by project group name
- ?o=project_name - sort by project name
- ?o=template_name - sort by template name
- ?o=project__customer__name - **deprecated**, use ?o=customer_name instead
- ?o=project__project_groups__name - **deprecated**, use ?o=project_group_name instead
- ?o=cores - sort by number of cores
- ?o=ram - sort by size of ram
- ?o=system_volume_size - sort by system volume size
- ?o=data_volume_size - sort by data volume size
- ?o=created - sort by creation time
- ?o=type - sort by resource type
- ?o=project__name - **deprecated**, use ?o=project_name instead
- ?o=template__name - **deprecated**, use ?o=template_name instead

Sorting can be done by the following fields, specifying field name as a parameter to **?o=<field_name>**. To get a
descending sorting prefix field name with a **-**.

Instance permissions
--------------------

- Staff members can list all available VM instances in any cloud.
- Customer owners can list all VM instances in all the clouds that belong to any of the customers they own.
- Project administrators can list all VM instances, create new instances and start/stop/restart instances in all the
  clouds that are connected to any of the projects they are administrators in.
- Project managers can list all VM instances in all the clouds that are connected to any of the projects they are
  managers in.

Instance state
--------------

Each instance has a **state** field that defines its current operational state. Instance has a FSM that defines possible
state transitions. If a request is made to perform an operation on instance in incorrect state, a validation
error will be returned.

The UI can poll for updates to provide feedback after submitting one of the longer running operations.

In a DB, state is stored encoded with a symbol. States are:

- PROVISIONING_SCHEDULED = 1
- PROVISIONING = 2
- ONLINE = 3
- OFFLINE = 4
- STARTING_SCHEDULED = 5
- STARTING = 6
- STOPPING_SCHEDULED = 7
- STOPPING = 8
- ERRED = 9
- DELETION_SCHEDULED = 10
- DELETING = 11
- RESIZING_SCHEDULED = 13
- RESIZING = 14
- RESTARTING_SCHEDULED = 15
- RESTARTING = 16

Any modification of an instance in unstable or PROVISIONING_SCHEDULED state is prohibited
and will fail with 409 response code. Assuming stable states are ONLINE and OFFLINE.

A graph of possible state transitions is shown below.

Create a new instance
---------------------

A new instance can be created by users with project administrator role or with staff privilege (is_staff=True).
To create a instance, client must define:

- hostname **deprecated**, use name instead;
- description (optional);
- link to the template object (it *must* be connected to a cloud, which is authorized for usage in the project);
- link to the flavor (it *must* belong to a cloud, which is authorized for usage in the project);
- link to the project;
- link to user's public key (user owning this key will be able to log in to the instance);
- external_ips (optional, each ip address *must* be from the list of :doc:`floating ips <floating_ips>`);
- security_groups (optional);
- system_volume_size in MiB (optional);
- data_volume_size in MiB (optional, sum of instance's system_volume_size and data_volume_size has to be lower
  than available storage quota);

Stopping/starting/restarting an instance
-----------------------------------------

To stop/start/restart an instance, run an authorized POST request against the instance UUID,
appending the requested command.
Examples of URLs:

- POST /api/instances/6c9b01c251c24174a6691a1f894fae31/start/
- POST /api/instances/6c9b01c251c24174a6691a1f894fae31/stop/
- POST /api/instances/6c9b01c251c24174a6691a1f894fae31/restart/

If instance is in the state that does not allow this transition, error code will be returned.

Resizing an instance
--------------------

To resize an instance, submit a POST request to the instance's RPC url, specifying URI of a target flavor.
Example of a valid request:


.. code-block:: http

    POST /api/instances/6c9b01c251c24174a6691a1f894fae31/resize/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com

    {
        "flavor": "http://example.com/api/flavors/1ee385bc043249498cfeb8c7e3e079f0/"
    }

To resize data disk of the instance, submit a POST request to the instance's RPC url, specifying size of the disk.
Additional size of instance cannot be over the storage quota.

Example of a valid request:


.. code-block:: http

    POST /api/instances/6c9b01c251c24174a6691a1f894fae31/resize/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com

    {
        "disk_size": 1024
    }

Deletion of an instance
-----------------------

Deletion of an instance is done through sending a DELETE request to the instance URI.
Valid request example (token is user specific):

.. code-block:: http

    DELETE /api/instances/6c9b01c251c24174a6691a1f894fae31/ HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com

NB! Only stopped instances can be deleted.


Instance usage info
-------------------

To get information about instance usage, make GET request to /api/instances/<uuid>/usage/ with such parameters:

- ?item=instance_usage_item(required. Have to be from list: 'cpu', 'memory', 'storage')
- ?from=timestamp(default: now - one hour, example: 1415910025)
- ?to=timestamp(default: now, example: 1415912625)
- ?datapoints=how many data points have to be in answer(default: 6)

Answer will be list of points(dictionaries) with fields: 'from', 'to', 'value'
