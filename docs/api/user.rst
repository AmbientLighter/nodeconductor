User list
---------

User list is available to all authenticated users. To get a list, issue authenticated GET request against **/api/users/**.

User list supports several filters. All filters are set in HTTP query section.
Field filters are listed below. All of the filters apart from ?organization are using case insensitive partial matching.

- ?full_name=
- ?native_name=
- ?organization= (deprecated, use
  `organization plugin <http://nodeconductor-organization.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ instead)
- ?organization_approved= (deprecated, use
  `organization plugin <http://nodeconductor-organization.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ instead)
- ?email=
- ?phone_number=
- ?description=
- ?job_title=
- ?username=
- ?project=
- ?project_group=

In addition, several custom filters are supported:

- ?current - filters out user making a request. Useful for getting information about a currently logged in user.
- ?civil_number=XXX - filters out users with a specified civil number
- ?is_active=True|False - show only active (non-active) users
- ?potential - shows users that have common connections to the customers and are potential collaborators. Exclude staff
  users. Staff users can see all the customers.
- ?potential_customer=<Customer UUID> - optionally filter potential users by customer UUID
- ?potential_organization=<organization name> - optionally filter potential unconnected users by their organization name
   (deprecated, use `organization plugin <http://nodeconductor-organization.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ instead)
- ?organization_claimed - show only users with a non-empty organization
  (deprecated, use `organization plugin <http://nodeconductor-organization.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ instead)

Ordering is supported by the fields below. Descending sorting can be achieved through prefixing
field name with a dash (**-**).

- ?o=full_name
- ?o=native_name
- ?o=organization (deprecated, use
  `organization plugin <http://nodeconductor-organization.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ instead)
- ?o=organization_approved (deprecated, use
  `organization plugin <http://nodeconductor-organization.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ instead)
- ?o=email
- ?o=phone_number
- ?o=description
- ?o=job_title
- ?o=username
- ?o=active


Creating a user
---------------

The user can be created either through automated process on login with SAML token, or through a REST call by a user
with staff privilege.

Example of a creation request is below.

.. code-block:: http

    POST /api/users/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com
    {
        "username": "sample-user",
        "full_name": "full name",
        "native_name": "t√§isnimi",
        "job_title": "senior cleaning manager",
        "email": "example@example.com",
        "civil_number": "12121212",
        "phone_number": "",
        "description": "",
        "organization": "",
    }

NB! Username field is case-insensitive. So "John" and "john" will be treated as the same user.

Updating a user
---------------

User fields can be updated by account owner or user with staff privilege (is_staff=True).
Following user fields can be updated:

- organization (deprecated, use
  `organization plugin <http://nodeconductor-organization.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ instead)
- full_name
- native_name
- job_title
- phone_number
- email

Can be done by PUTing a new data to the user URI, i.e. **/api/users/<UUID>/** by staff user or account owner.
Valid request example (token is user specific):

.. code-block:: http

    PUT /api/users/e0c058d06864441fb4f1c40dee5dd4fd/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com

    {
        "email": "example@example.com",
        "organization": "Bells organization",
    }

Changing password
-----------------

To change a user password, submit a POST request to the user's RPC url, specifying new password
by staff user or account owner.

Password validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Password is expected to be at least 7 symbols long and contain at least one number and at least one lower or upper case.

Example of a valid request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST /api/users/e0c058d06864441fb4f1c40dee5dd4fd/password/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com

    {
        "password": "nQvqHzeP123",
    }


User organization management
----------------------------

**Deprecated, use**
`organization plugin <http://nodeconductor-organization.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ **instead.**

There is a lightweight mechanism available that allows users with customer owner roles to control
claims of users about their organizations.

A user can claim his belonging to a particular organization by POSTing its value
to **/api/users/<uuid>/claim_organization/**. At most one claim can be done. Once the claim is done,
it remains pending till customer owner or staff performs one of the actions described below.

.. code-block:: http

    POST /api/users/e0c058d06864441fb4f1c40dee5dd4fd/claim_organization/ HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Token c84d653b9ec92c6cbac41c706593e66f567a7fa4
    Host: example.com

    {
        "organization": "My Organization Abbreviation"
    }

A customer owner of a customer with an equal abbreviation can then approve or reject the claim by POSTing
to **/api/users/<uuid>/approve_organization/** or **/api/users/<uuid>/reject_organization/**. A customer owner
can also remove approved user by POSTing to **/api/users/<uuid>/remove_organization/**.

A status of approval is visible from the **organization_approved** property of a user.
