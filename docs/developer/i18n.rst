Internationalization
====================

Per-request internationalization is enabled by default for English and Estonian languages.
Client requests will respect the `Accept-Language`.

Here are the guidelines for specifing translation strings:

* Build a proper sentence: start with a capital letter, end with a period.

  **Right:** :code:`_('Deletion was scheduled.')`

  **Wrong:** :code:`_('deletion was scheduled')`

* Use named-string interpolation instead of positional interpolation.

  **Right:** :code:`_('Operation was successfully scheduled for %(count)d instances: %(names)s.')`

  **Wrong:** :code:`_('Operation was successfully scheduled for %s instances: %s.')`

* help_text, verbose_name, exception message and response message should be marked,
  but don't mark message template for event or alert logger.

Note that in order to customize error messages defined in DRF itself, you should merge
the REST framework source django.po file into nodeconductor/locale folder.

Please note that status codes should **not** be translated, as it would break output format rendering.
This inconsistency should be fixed in further releases.
