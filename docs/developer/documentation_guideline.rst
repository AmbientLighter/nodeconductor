======================

1. Keep plugin's documentation withing plugin's code repository.
2. The documentation page should start with plugin's title and description.
3. Keep plugin's documentation page structure similar to the NodeConductor's main documentation page:

    * **Guide**
        * should contain at least **installation** steps.
    * **API**
        * should include description of API extension, if any.

4. Setup `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ documentation rendering and issue a merge request
   against NodeConductor's repository with a link.
5. Add section with description and link of the plugin to
   NodeConductor's plugin `section <../index.html#nodeconductor-plugins>`_.
