NodeConductor Extensions
========================

NodeConductor extensions (like NodeConducorPlus) are developed as auto-configurable plugins. It's only required to add desired application to INSTALLED_APPS. Extensions' URL's will be registered automatically if settings.NODECONDUCTOR['EXTENSIONS AUTOREGISTER'] is True, which is default.
