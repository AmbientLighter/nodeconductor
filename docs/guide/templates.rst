Templates
---------

A NodeConductor template is a way to group typically provisioned resource templates. For example, a template called
'My development infrastructure' can contain a template for IaaS service, an issue tracking service and a
code repository service. In addition, it is possible to provide a default configuration for added value services
like monitoring or backup.

A REST client can request available packages and use them as a shortcut when provisioning resources.
